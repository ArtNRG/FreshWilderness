# Non Free Plugins
The following non-free plugins are required:
* Kingdoms+: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/kingdoms-battle-for-land-might-and-glory.11833/ (although there is a free "light" version, its API is not up to date)
* Townships: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/townships.25944/

Gradle will automatically pull in all jar files in this directory.
