# CraftBukkit
These jars are not suitable to be in a git repository (they're massive), and as craftbukkit jars are not available on maven or build repositories you are required to add these jars yourself:
* spigot-1.7.10.jar
* spigot-1.8.8.jar
* spigot-1.9.jar
* spigot-1.9.4.jar
* spigot-1.10.1.jar
* spigot-1.11.10.jar

Gradle will automatically pull in all jar files in this directory.
